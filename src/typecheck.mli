(** [check_defs backend_targets mod_name filename session mod_in_output env ast] typescheck the parsed module
    [ast] from file [filename] in environment [env]. It is assumed that mainly the backends
    [backend_targets] will be used later, i.e. only for these backends 
    problems like missing definitions are reported. However,
    information for all targets is still  The new definitions are added 
    to the environment as new module [mod_name]. The result is a new
    environment as well as the type-checked ast of the module. The flag [mod_in_output] is
    stored in the resulting module description. It signals, whether the module will be
    written to file. The parameter [session] contains the optional Isabelle
    session that includes this module. *)
