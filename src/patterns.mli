type match_props = {is_exhaustive: bool; missing_pats : pat list list; redundant_pats: (int * pat) list; overlapping_pats: ((int * pat) * (int * pat)) list}

(** [check_match_exp env e] checks the pattern match expression [e] in environment [env]. If
    [e] is not a pattern match, [None] is returned. Otherwise, a record of type [match_props] is
    returned that contains information on whether the match is exhaustive, contains redundant parts etc. *)
val check_match_exp : env -> exp -> match_props option

(** [check_pat_list env pl] checks the pattern list [pL] in environment [env]. If
    [pL] is empty or the compilation fails, [None] is returned. Otherwise, a record of type [match_props] is
    returned that contains information on whether the match is exhaustive, contains redundant parts etc. *)
val check_pat_list : env -> pat list -> match_props option

(** [check_match_exp_warn env e] internally calls [check_match_exp env e]. Instead of returning 
    the properties of the match expression, it prints appropriate warning messages, though. *)
val check_match_exp_warn : env -> exp -> unit

(** [check_match_def env d] checks a definition using pattern matching [d] in environment [env]. 
    Definitions of mutually recursive functions can contain multiple top-level pattern matches.
    Therefore, a list is returned. This lists consists of pairs of
    the name of the defined function and it's properties. If the definition does not have a top-level pattern match,
    i.e. if it is not a function definition, the empty list is returned. *)

(** [check_match_def_warn env d] checks a definition and prints appropriate warning messages. *)

(** [cleanup_match_exp env add_missing e] tries to cleanup the match-expression [e] by removing
    redunanant rows. Moreover, missing patterns are added at the end, if the argument [add_missing] 
    is set.*)
val cleanup_match_exp : env -> bool -> exp -> exp option

(** [compile_match_exp target_opt pat_OK env e] compiles match-expressions. In contrast to
    [check_match_exp] only case-expressions are checked. Other types of pattern matches
    have to be brought into this form first.

    If the case-expression [e] contains a pattern [p] such that [pat_OK p] does not hold,
    the whole case-expression is processed and transformed into an expression with
    the same semantics that contains only supported patterns. During this compilation, 
    warning messages might be issued. This warning uses [target_opt]. Otherwise, it is not used.*)
val compile_match_exp : target -> match_check_arg -> env -> exp -> exp option

(** [compile_relation_exp env fail choose e] compiles
    match-expressions as inductive relations.

    Redundant matches are kept and merged using the [choose] function,
    while non-exhaustive matches are completed through with the [fail]
    function. *)

(** [checked_number_patterns env p] checks that all number patterns which are part of [p] are
    of type nat or natural. *)
val check_number_patterns : env -> pat -> unit

(** [remove_function env case_f e] replaces the function expression [e] with with [fun x -> match x with ...].
    The function [case_f] is then applied to the new match-expression. *)
val remove_function : env -> (exp -> exp) -> exp -> exp option

(** [remove_fun env case_f e] replaces the fun-expression [e]. If [e] is of the form [fun p0 ... pn -> e'] such that
    not all patterns [pi] are variable patterns, it is replaced with [fun x0 ... xn -> match (x0, ..., xn) with (p0, ..., pn) -> e'].
    The function [case_f] is then applied to the new match-expression. *)
val remove_fun : env -> (exp -> exp) -> exp -> exp option

(** [add_no_toplevel_type s] inhibits remove_toplevel_match on the given type [s] *)
val add_no_toplevel_type : string -> unit

(** [remove_toplevel_match] tries to introduce matching directly in the function definition by
    eliminating match-expressions in the body. *)
val remove_toplevel_match : target -> match_check_arg -> env -> Def_trans.def_macro

(** [collapse_nested_matches] tries to eliminate nested matches by collapsing them. It is used internally by pattern
    compilation. *)
