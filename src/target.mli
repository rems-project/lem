(** Datatype and Function for Targets *)

(** A datatype for Targets. In contrast to the one in
    [ast.ml] this one does not carry white-space information. *)
type non_ident_target =
  | Target_hol
  | Target_ocaml
  | Target_isa
  | Target_coq
  | Target_tex
  | Target_html
  | Target_lem

(** [target] for the typechecked ast is either a real target as in the AST or
    the identity target *)
type target =
  | Target_no_ident of non_ident_target
  | Target_ident

(** [ast_target_to_target t] converts an ast-target to a
    target. This essentially means dropping the white-space information. *)
val ast_target_to_target : Ast.target -> non_ident_target

(** [target_to_ast_target t] converts a target [t] to an
    ast_target. This essentially means adding empty white-space information. *)
val target_to_ast_target : non_ident_target -> Ast.target

(** [ast_target_compare] is a comparison function for ast-targets. *)
val ast_target_compare : Ast.target -> Ast.target -> int

(** [target_compare] is a comparison function for targets. *)
val target_compare : non_ident_target -> non_ident_target -> int

(** target keyed finite maps *)
module Targetmap : sig
   include Finite_map.Fmap with type k = non_ident_target

   (** [apply_target m targ] looks up the [targ] in map [m].
       Target-maps only store information for real targets, not the identity one.
       If therefore [targ] is [Target_ident], i.e. represents the identity backend,
       [None] is returned. *)
   val apply_target : 'a t -> target -> 'a option

   (** [insert_target m (targ, v)] inserts value [v] for [targ] in map [m].
       Target-maps only store information for real targets, not the identity one.
       If therefore [targ] is [Target_ident], i.e. represents the identity backend,
       the map is not(!) updated. *)
   val insert_target : 'a t -> (target * 'a) -> 'a t
end

(** target sets *)
module Targetset : Set.S with type elt = non_ident_target

(** A list of all the targets. *)
val all_targets_list : non_ident_target list

(** The set of all the targets. *)
val all_targets : Targetset.t

(** The set of targets used when negating or no mentioning explicit targets. Targets like Lem are excluded by default. *)
val all_targets_non_explicit : Targetset.t

(** The set of targets that can handle only executable definitions.
    Currently only Ocaml, but this might change. *)
val all_targets_only_exec : Targetset.t
val all_targets_only_exec_list : non_ident_target list

(** [non_ident_target_to_string t] returns a string description of a target [t]. *)
val non_ident_target_to_string : non_ident_target -> string

(** [target_to_string t_opt] returns a string description of a target.
    If some target is given, it does the same as [target_to_string]. Otherwise,
    it returns a string description of the identity backend. *)
val target_to_string : target -> string

(** [non_ident_target_to_mname t] returns a name for a target. It is similar to
    [non_ident_target_to_string t]. However, it returns capitalised versions. *)
val non_ident_target_to_mname : non_ident_target -> Name.t

(** [target_to_output t] returns output for a target [t]. *)
val target_to_output : Ast.target -> Output.t

(** [is_human_target targ] checks whether [targ] is a target intended to be read by humans
    and therefore needs preserving the original structure very closely. Examples for such targets are
    the tex-, html- and identity-targets. *)
val is_human_target : target -> bool

(** [is_tex_target targ] checks whether [targ] is the TeX target. *)
val is_tex_target : target -> bool

(** [suppress_targets targ tex_flag] returns whether a target must print let-bindings
    defined for a subset of target backends as normal let-bindings in the TeX backend. *)
val suppress_targets : target -> bool -> bool

(** [dest_human_target targ] destructs [targ] to get the non-identity target. If it s a human-target,
    [None] is returned, otherwise the non-identity target. *)
val dest_human_target : target -> non_ident_target option
