val def_add_location_comment_flag : bool ref

(** If [def_add_location_comment_flag] is set, [def_add_location_comment d] adds a comment with location information
    before definition [d]. This may require changing the initial whitespace before the definition. Therefore, the
    [def_aux] of [d] with changed whitespace as well as the output that should be added before [d] is returned. *)

val get_module_open_string : env -> Target.target -> string -> bool -> Path.t -> string


(** [isa_add_full_library_path_flag] controls whether the full path to directory [isabelle-lib] is added to
    Lem library modules imported by files outside the lib. This is useful to process the files easily from Isabelle, without
    providing the path these library modules can be found explicitly to Isabelle. The resulting files are however not
    directly portable. Therefore, this flag is turned off by default and it is recommended to add the isabelle-library
    directory instead to your [.isabelle/YOUR VERSION/ROOTS] file. *)
val isa_add_full_library_path_flag : bool ref

(** [get_imported_target_modules env targ defs] extracts a list of module that should be imported.
    The exact names of these modules depend on the environment and the target. Therefore, they get extracted in
    an abstract from and converted (after possible changes to the environment) by
    [imported_modules_to_strings].*)
val get_imported_target_modules : Typed_ast.def list * Ast.lex_skips -> Imported_Modules_Set.t

(** [imported_modules_to_strings env targ dir imported_mods relative] is used together with [get_imported_target_modules]. Please see there. *)

(** [function_application_to_output l exp inf full_exp c_id args] tries to format
    a function application as output. It gets an expression [full_ex] of the from
    [c arg1 ... argn]. The id [c_id] corresponds to constant [c]. The arguments [arg1, ... argn] are
    handed over as [args]. The description corresponding to [c] is looked up in [A.env]. Depending on
    this description and the backend-specific formats therein, the
    function and its arguments are formated as output.  In the
    simplest case the representation is an identifier ([Ident.t]),
    which is formated using [A.id_format_args] and the information,
    whether it the whole expression is an infix one [inf]. In more complicated
    cases, formating of expressions is needed, which is done via the
    callback [exp]. In particular if some arguments are not needed by
    the formating of the function application, the function [exp] is
    called on these remaining arguments. The original expression [full_exp] is
    needed, if not enough parameters are present to format the definition correctly.
    In this case, eta-expansion is applied and the resulting expression formatting via [exp].
    [ascii_alternative] denotes whether an ascii alternative representation for this
    function name is required.
*)
val function_application_to_output : Ast.l -> (exp -> Output.t) -> bool -> exp -> const_descr_ref id -> exp list -> bool -> Output.t list

(** [pattern_application_to_output l pat c_id args] tries to
    format a function application in a pattern as output. It does otherwise the same as
    function_application_to_output. However, since there are no infix patterns, the
    parameter [inf] is always set to [false].
*)
val pattern_application_to_output : Ast.l -> (pat -> Output.t) -> const_descr_ref id -> pat list -> bool -> Output.t list

(** [const_id_to_ident c_id use_ascii] tries to format a constant, constructor or field
    [c_id] as an identifier for target [A.target] using the rules stored
    in environment [A.env]. If the flag [use_ascii] is set, the ascii representation of the
    constant should be used, if there is one. Depending on the formating rules for the
    constant, [const_id_to_ident] might raise an exception. *)
val const_id_to_ident : const_descr_ref id -> bool -> Ident.t


(** [const_ref_to_name n use_ascii c] tries to format a constant
    [c] for target [A.target] using the rules stored
    in environment [A.env]. If [use_ascii] is set, the ascii-representation is
    returned. [const_ref_to_name] always returns a name [n']. If special formatting
    rules are installed, this name might not be the one used by [function_application_to_output], though.
    The argument [n] is the name used in the original input. It's whitespace is used to
    format [n']. *)
val const_ref_to_name : Name.lskips_t -> bool -> const_descr_ref -> Name.lskips_t

(** [type_path_to_name n p] tries to format a type-path
    [p] for target [A.target] using the rules stored
    in environment [A.env]. It always returns a name [n']. If special formatting
    rules are installed, this name might not be the one used by [function_application_to_output], though.
    The argument [n] is the name used in the original input. It's whitespace is used to
    format [n']. *)
val type_path_to_name : Name.lskips_t -> Path.t -> Name.lskips_t

(** [type_id_to_ident ty_id] tries to format a type
    [ty_id] as an identifier for target [A.target] using the rules stored
    in environment [A.env].
*)
val type_id_to_ident : Path.t id -> Ident.t

(** [type_id_to_output ty_id] tries to format a type
    [ty_id] as an identifier for target [A.target] using the rules stored
    in environment [A.env].
*)
val type_id_to_output : Path.t id -> Output.t

(** [type_id_to_ident_no_modify ty_id] formats [ty_id] as an identifier.
    In contrast to [type_id_to_ident] neither the target [A.target] nor the rules stored
    in environment [A.env] are used. Instead the type is translated without any
    modifications. This method is intended to be used for backend types, which
    are already formatted.
