(** The distinction between [cur_env], [new_defs] and [export_env] is interesting.
    [cur_env] contains the local environment as seen by a function inside the module.
    [new_defs] in contrast contains only the definitions made inside the module. It is
    used to check for duplicate definitions. [export_env] is the outside view of the module.
    It contains all definitions made inside the module (i.e. [new_defs]) as well as
    the included modules (see command [include]). *)
