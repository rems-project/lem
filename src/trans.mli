  (** {2 Record Macros} *)

      records that have only one field with the construction
      of a completely new record. *)
  val remove_singleton_record_updates : exp macro

  (** [remove_multiple_record_updates] replaces record updates
      simultaneously updating multiple fields with a nested record
      update, each affecting only one field, that achieves the same
      effect. *)
  val remove_multiple_record_updates : exp macro

  (** [sort_record_fields] sorts the fields of a record expression
      into the same order as in the definition of the record
      type. If they do not need resorting, everything is fine,
      otherwise a warning is produced. *)
  val sort_record_fields : exp macro

  (** {2 Set and List Comprehension Macros} *)

  (** [remove_list_comprehension] removes list comprehensions by turning
      them into fold and insert operations. A [Trans_error] exception is
      thrown, if not only bounded quantification is used. *)
  val remove_list_comprehension : exp macro

  (** [remove_set_comprehension] removes set comprehensions by turning
      them into fold and insert operations. A [Trans_error] exception is
      thrown, if not only bounded quantification is used. *)
  val remove_set_comprehension : exp macro

  (** [remove_setcomp] removes set comprehensions with implicit bound variable to ones with
      explicitly bound onces. For example [{ (x, y) | x > y }] might, depending on context be turned
      in [{ (x, y) | forall x | x > y}], [{ (x, y) | forall x y | x > y}] or something similar.*)
  val remove_setcomp : exp macro

  (** [cleanup_set_quant] moves restricted and unrestricted quantification 
      in set comprehensions to the condition part, if the bound variables are only used by the condition.
      This means, that expressions of the form [{ f x | forall (p IN e) ... | P x }] become
      [{ f x | forall ... | exists (p IN e). P x }] if [x] is not a member of [FV p].
  *)
  val cleanup_set_quant : exp macro

  (** [remove_set_comp_binding] tries to turn [Comb_binding] expressions into [Set_comb] ones. 
      Given a term of the form [{ f x z | forall x z | P x z y1 ... yn }] it checks that only
      unbounded quantification is used and that the set of bound variables is exactly the set of free
      variables of the expression [f x z]. If this is the case, the expression is transformed to 
      [{ f x z | P x z y1 ... yn }]. Otherwise [remove_set_comp_binding] fails. *)
  val remove_set_comp_binding : exp macro

  (** [remove_set_restr_quant] turns restricted quantification in set comprehensions 
      into unrestricted quantification. Expressions of the form [{ f x | forall (p IN e) | P x }] become
      [{ f x | FV(p) | forall FV(p). p IN e /\ P x }]. This requires turning pattern [p] into
      an expression. This is likely to fail for more complex patterns. In these cases, [remove_set_restr_quant]
      fails and pattern compilation is needed. *)
  val remove_set_restr_quant : exp macro

  (** {2 Quantifier Macros} *)

  (** [list_quant_to_set_quant] turns [forall (x MEM L). P x] into [forall (x IN Set.from_list L). P x] *)
  val list_quant_to_set_quant : exp macro

  (** [remove_restr_quant pat_OK] turns restricted quantification into unrestricted quantification,
      if then pattern does not satisfy [pat_OK]. For example, expressions of the from [forall (p IN e). P x] becomes
      [forall FV(p). p IN e --> P x], if [pat_OK p] does not hold. [pat_OK] is used to configure, which types
      of restricted quantification are supported by the backend. For example, HOL 4 supports 
      patterns consisting of variables, tuples and wildcard patterns, while Isabelle does not like wildcard ones.
      This macros tries to turn pattern [p] into
      an expression. This is likely to fail for more complex patterns. In these cases, [remove_restr_quant pat_OK]
      fails and pattern compilation is needed. *)
  val remove_restr_quant : (pat -> bool) -> exp macro

  (** [remove_quant] turns quantifiers into iteration. It throws an [Trans_error] exception, if used
      on unrestricted quantification. Given an expression [forall (x IN X). P x] this returns
      [Set.forall X (fun x -> P x)]. It also works for existential quantification and quantification
      over lists. *)
  val remove_quant : exp macro

  (** [remove_quant_coq] the same as above but does not apply in the body of lemma or theorem
      statements.  Specific to the Coq backend. *)
  val remove_quant_coq : exp macro

  (** {2 Pattern Macros} *)

  (** [remove_unit_pats] replaces unit-patterns [()] with wildcard ones [_]. *)
  val remove_unit_pats : pat_macro

  (** Add type annotations to pattern variables whose type contains a type variable
     (only add for arguments to top-level functions) *)
  val coq_type_annot_pat_vars : pat_macro

  (** {2 Type Class Macros } *)

   (** [remove_method target add_dict] is used to remove occurrences of class methods. 
       If a class method is encountered, the [remove_method] macro first tries to 
       resolve the type-class instantiation statically and replace the method with it's
       instantiation. If this static resolving attempt fails, it is checked, whether the method
       is inlined for this target. If this is not the case and the flag [add_dict] is set, 
       the method is replaced with a lookup in a dictionary. This dictionary is added by the
       [Def_trans.class_constraint_to_parameter] to the arguments of each definition that
       has type class constraints. *)
  val remove_method : Target.target -> bool -> exp macro

   (** [remove_method_pat] is used to remove occurrences of class methods. 
       If a class method is encountered, [remove_method_pat] macro tries to 
       resolve the type-class instantiation statically and replace the method with it's
       instantiation. *)
  val remove_method_pat : pat_macro

   (** [remove_num_lit is_numeral] replaces expressions [L_num (sk, i)] for which
       [is_numeral] returns [true] with [fromNumeral (L_numeral (sk, i))].
       This is the first step into using type classes to handle numerals.  *)
  val remove_num_lit : (exp -> bool) -> exp macro

  (** [remove_class_const] remove constants that have class constraints by adding
      explicit dictionary parameters. *)
  val remove_class_const : Target.target -> exp macro

  (** {2 Misc} *)

  (** [remove_junk_from_within_nil] removes any comments or whitespace from within
      the middle of a list nil pattern, which confuses Isabelle's parser. *)
  val remove_junk_from_within_nil : exp macro

  (** [remove_function] turns [function | pat1 -> exp1 ... | patn -> expn end] into
      [fun x -> match x with | pat1 -> exp1 ... | patn -> expn end]. *)
  val remove_function : exp macro

  (** Warning: OCaml specific! [remove_sets] transforms set expressions like [{e1, ..., en}] into
      [Ocaml.Pset.from_list (type_specific compare) [e1, ..., en]] *)
  val remove_sets : exp macro

  (** [remove_fun_pats keep_tup] removes patterns from expressions of the from
      [fun p1 ... pn -> e] by introducing [function] expressions. 
      Variable patterns and - if [keep_tup] is set - tuple patterns are kept. *)
  val remove_fun_pats : bool -> exp macro

  (** [remove_failwith_matches] removes branches in match statements that contain only
      "failwith" or "fail" from the Lem library module Assert_extra and replace them
      with partial matches.
    *)
  val remove_failwith_matches : exp macro

  (** [eta_expand_constructors] eta expands constructors, introducing a new function
      that takes the required number of arguments and immediately applies them to
      the constructor: useful in the OCaml backend where
        let f = Some
      is invalid as constructors are not merely constants of functional type, but
      must be explicitly applied to arguments, like:
        let f = fun x -> Some x
