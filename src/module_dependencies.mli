(** module dependency resolution *)

(** [process_files allow_reorder lib_dirs files] parses the files in list [files]. 
    It checks for [import] statements and tries to automatically load
    the needed files for those as well. Therefore, files are searched in
    the directories [lib_dirs]. If [allow_reorder] is set, it may also reorder the order of
    file in [files] to satisfy dependencies.   

    The result is a list of tuples
    [(module_name, filename, ast, needs_output)]. The flag
    [needs_output] states, whether an output file should be produced.
    It is set to false for all automatically imported modules. Since one
    might to also want to add library modules manually, the input 
    [files] is a list of file names and need-output flags as well.
