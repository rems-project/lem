(** {2 Infrastructure form definition macros} *)

(** [def_macro] is the type of definition macros. A definition macro [def_mac] gets the arguments
    [rev_path], [env] and [d]. The argument [d] is the definition the macro should process.
    [rev_path] represents the path of the module of definition [d] as a list of names in reverse order.
    [env] is the local environment for the module of [d]. This means that also the definitions in
    the same module that follow [d] are present. If the macro does not modify the definition, it should
    return [None]. Otherwise, it should return a pair [Some (env', ds)], where [env'] is a updated environment 
    and [ds] a list of definitions that replace [d]. *)
type def_macro = Name.t list -> env -> def -> (env * def list) option

(** [list_to_mac macro_list] collapses a list of [def_macros] into a single one.
    It looks for the first macro in the list that succeeds, i.e. returns not [None] and
    returns the result of this macro. *)
val list_to_mac : def_macro list -> def_macro

(** [process_defs rev_path def_mac mod_name env ds] is intended to run the macro [def_mac] over all
    definitions in module [mod_name]. The argument [rev_path] is the path to module [mod_name] in reversed order.
    [env] is the environment containing module [mod_name] and [ds] is the list of definitions in this module.
    If [def_mac] modifies a definition [d] to a list [ds], it is then run on all definitions in [ds].     
    If one of the is a module-definition, which is not modified by [ds], then [def_macro] is run 
    on all definitions inside this module. For this recursive call the path, module name and environment are adapted.

    The result of [process_defs] is an updated environment and a new list of definitons. *)
val process_defs : Name.t list -> def_macro -> Name.t -> env -> def list -> (env * def list)


(** {2 Dictionary passing} *)

(** Type classes are not supported by all backends. The [def_macro] [class_to_record] takes a
    definition of a type class and turns it into a definition of a record type. The methods of the
    class become field of the record. This record can then be used as the dictionary type for the
    dictionary passing. *)
val class_to_record : Target.target -> def_macro

(** Removes inline instances for backends that employ typeclasses. *)
val comment_out_inline_instances_and_classes : Target.target -> def_macro

(** [instance_to_dict do_inline targ] turns instance declarations into a definition of a dictionary record.
    If [do_inline] is set, this definition will be inlined (for this the target argument is needed). *)
val instance_to_dict : bool -> Target.target -> def_macro

val class_constraint_to_parameter : Target.target -> def_macro


(** {2 Open / Include / Import} *)

(** [remove_opens] removes all open / include and import statements *)
val remove_opens : def_macro

(** [remove_import_include] removes all import and include statements. Imports are deleted and
    includes turned into open statements. *)
val remove_import_include : def_macro

(** [remove_import] removes all import statements. *)
val remove_import : def_macro

(** [remove_module_renames] removes all module rename statements. *)
val remove_module_renames : def_macro

(** {2 Misc} *)

(** If a target representation for a type is given, the original type definition is commented out.
    Notice that target-specific renamings are not target representations. *)
val remove_types_with_target_rep : Target.target -> def_macro

(** If a target representation for a constant is given, the original definition is not needed.
    However, turn this definition into a lemma to ensure that the target representation is sensible. *)
