synopsis: "Lem is a tool for lightweight executable mathematics"
description: """
Lem is a tool for lightweight executable mathematics, for writing,
managing, and publishing large-scale portable semantic definitions,
with export to LaTeX, executable code (currently OCaml) and
interactive theorem provers (currently Coq, HOL4, and Isabelle/HOL).

It is also intended as an intermediate language for generating
definitions from domain-specific tools, and for porting definitions
between interactive theorem proving systems."""
