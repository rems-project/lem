# LemLib — Lean 4 runtime library for Lem

Provides the core types and operations that Lem-generated Lean 4 code depends on:
- `LemOrdering`: three-way comparison type used by set/map operations
- Comparison, arithmetic, and string helpers
- Set and finite-map operations: `Pset`/`Pmap`, translations of Lem's OCaml
  runtime AVL trees (ocaml-lib/pset.ml, pmap.ml). The parity probes and
  LemLibPmapLaws check specific observations and local laws; they are not
  a general correspondence proof. See README.md for the dated validation
  pins and failure/representation limits.

**Convention**: Functions suffixed with `By` take an explicit `(cmp : α → α → LemOrdering)`
comparator. Functions without `By` use Lean's `BEq` or `Ord` type classes.
-/

/- Lem standard library support for Lean 4 -/

/- NO AXIOM AND NO UNSAFE INHABITANT MAY BE INTRODUCED HERE. Two were
   removed and must not come back:
   - an axiom-valued universal inhabitant (`axiom DAEMON : ∀ {α : Type}, α`,
     the value of a legacy `failwith`): logically inconsistent —
     `(DAEMON : Empty)` proves `False`. The backend derives real bounded
     `Inhabited` instances instead and emits `failwithI` (below) with
     `[Inhabited tv]` binders threaded onto the enclosing signatures;
   - an effect-erasure axiom (`runEffectful : (Unit → BaseIO α) → α`, the
     trust boundary of `declare {lean} effectful` target reps): an
     unprovable crossing in every downstream proof cone. Effectful counters
     are threaded as explicit state by the supply lifting (`declare {lean}
     supply val`, `LemLib.supplySplit` below — deterministic,
     kernel-transparent, axiom-free), and the backend refuses that
     declare (deletion record:
     doc/lean-backend/2026-09-01_L2-deletion-record.md).
   Consumers enforce the absence in-build (cerberus-lean
   `scripts/check_theorem_axioms.sh`: a zero-axiom census over the
   hand-written and generated Lean trees plus `#print axioms` probes on
   exemplar cones). -/

/- THE AMBIENT FUEL. `declare {lean}
   fuel val f = `sentinel`` makes `f` a total worker recursing
   structurally on its own counter (`f_lemFuel (lemFuel : Nat) …`); the
   counter STARTS at the ambient fuel, and the ambient fuel is a
   PARAMETER of the generated code: this class, taken as an
   instance-implicit `[LemFuel]` binder by every fuel'd function and by
   every definition that (transitively) reaches one (the backend's fuel
   lifting). The wrapper is `def f [LemFuel] : … := f_lemFuel LemFuel.fuel`,
   so `@f ⟨n⟩ = f_lemFuel n` by rfl, a theorem quantifies `∀ [LemFuel]`
   (or over `n` via `⟨n⟩`), and the executable entry point instantiates it
   once (`letI : LemFuel := ⟨n⟩` at the CLI). NO INSTANCE IS DECLARED
   HERE OR IN ANY GENERATED CODE, by design: [USER 2026-09-03] fuel is an
   execution parameter whose value does not matter, any fuel value can be
   chosen, and every similar magic value is to be removed and replaced
   by a quantified parameter; a global instance would silently give every
   fuel'd function a default, which is exactly the forbidden magic value;
   so would a library default fuel constant, which this file once had
   (tests/comprehensive/check_no_fuel_numerals.sh gates the absence of
   both). -/
class LemFuel where
  fuel : Nat

/- Supply threading ('declare {lean} supply val', the state-passing
   analog of the reader lifting): a DRAW splits the current supply into
   the drawn value and the successor supply. The backend emits
   `let (v, s') := LemLib.supplySplit s` at every draw site of a lifted
   definition. A plain def by design — kernel-transparent (proofs
   unfold it), greppable, no effects anywhere in the mechanism:
   supply threading is deterministic state-passing and introduces no
   nondeterminism or IO. -/
def LemLib.supplySplit (s : Nat) : Nat × Nat := (s, s + 1)

/- Lem uses lowercase 'vector' for its built-in vector type -/
abbrev vector (α : Type) (n : Nat) := Vector α n


/- Ordering type for comparisons -/
inductive LemOrdering where
  | LT : LemOrdering
  | EQ : LemOrdering
  | GT : LemOrdering
  deriving Repr, BEq, Inhabited, DecidableEq

/- Lem's Bool conditional. Generated code writes
   `lem_if c then t else e` for a Lem `if` (whose condition is a `bool`).
   It expands to exactly the kernel term Lean elaborates for a Bool `if`
   (`ite (c = true)` with the `instDecidableEqBool` instance, pinned in
   LemLibTest), but builds it directly: no Bool->Prop coercion search and no
   Decidable instance search, which Lean runs behind `wait_if_type_mvar%`
   and which can get stuck in context (linksem link.lem). The instance's
   arguments are filled by unification, so the condition is written once.
   For a Prop-valued condition (only possible through a target rep that
   produces a Prop) Lean coerces with `decide`: same behaviour, different
   term. -/
syntax (name := lemIfThenElse)
  ppRealGroup(ppRealFill(ppIndent("lem_if " term " then") ppSpace term)
    ppDedent(ppSpace) ppRealFill("else " term)) : term
macro_rules
  | `(lem_if $c then $t else $e) => `(@ite _ ($c = true) (instDecidableEqBool _ _) $t $e)

/- Ordering predicates -/
def isLess (o : LemOrdering) : Bool := o == .LT
def isLessEqual (o : LemOrdering) : Bool := o != .GT
def isGreater (o : LemOrdering) : Bool := o == .GT
def isGreaterEqual (o : LemOrdering) : Bool := o != .LT

/- Inhabited for Sum (not in Lean core; needed by ground-typed failwithI
   sites at sum types). Left-biased, right as fallback. -/
instance [Inhabited α] : Inhabited (α ⊕ β) := ⟨.inl default⟩
instance (priority := low) [Inhabited β] : Inhabited (α ⊕ β) := ⟨.inr default⟩

/- BEq/Ord for Sum (neither is in Lean core). Unblocks `deriving BEq,
   Ord` on generated types with either-typed constructor fields.
   OCaml-polymorphic-comparison parity: lem `either 'a 'b = Left of 'a
   | Right of 'b` (library/either.lem:16) renders on the OCaml backend
   as `Either.either` (either.lem:20), i.e. OCaml's
   `type ('a,'b) t = Left of 'a | Right of 'b`: both constructors are blocks
   with tags in declaration order (Left = 0, Right = 1). OCaml (=) is
   structural per constructor; OCaml compare orders by tag first, then
   fields left-to-right (runtime/compare.c: tag comparison precedes
   field walk). Mirror: inl/Left < inr/Right, payload comparison within
   the same constructor, structural equality across. -/
instance [BEq α] [BEq β] : BEq (α ⊕ β) where
  beq
    | .inl a, .inl b => a == b
    | .inr a, .inr b => a == b
    | _, _ => false

instance [Ord α] [Ord β] : Ord (α ⊕ β) where
  compare
    | .inl a, .inl b => compare a b
    | .inl _, .inr _ => .lt
    | .inr _, .inl _ => .gt
    | .inr a, .inr b => compare a b

/- Ord for Unit (not in Lean stdlib, needed by generated code) -/
instance : Ord Unit where compare _ _ := .eq

/- Ord for LemOrdering: Lem programs build sets of
   comparison results (`Set.member (compare a b) {LT; EQ}`), which needs
   `SetType ordering`, derived from `Ord`. The order is the OCaml target's:
   `ordering` is `int` there with LT = -1, EQ = 0, GT = 1, so LT < EQ < GT. -/
instance : Ord LemOrdering where
  compare a b :=
    let rank : LemOrdering → Nat := fun | .LT => 0 | .EQ => 1 | .GT => 2
    compare (rank a) (rank b)

/- Ord instance for Prod (not in Lean stdlib) -/
instance [Ord α] [Ord β] : Ord (α × β) where
  compare p q :=
    match compare p.1 q.1 with
    | .lt => .lt
    | .gt => .gt
    | .eq => compare p.2 q.2

/- Default comparison via Ord -/
def defaultCompare [Ord α] (x y : α) : LemOrdering :=
  match compare x y with
  | .lt => .LT
  | .eq => .EQ
  | .gt => .GT

def defaultLess [Ord α] (x y : α) : Bool := isLess (defaultCompare x y)
def defaultLessEq [Ord α] (x y : α) : Bool := isLessEqual (defaultCompare x y)
def defaultGreater [Ord α] (x y : α) : Bool := isGreater (defaultCompare x y)
def defaultGreaterEq [Ord α] (x y : α) : Bool := isGreaterEqual (defaultCompare x y)

/- failwithI: failure at a KNOWN-INHABITED type. The Lean
   backend emits this instead of failwith at call sites whose result type
   is syntactically GROUND (no type variables), where instance resolution
   cannot require constraint propagation. Properties, each load-bearing:
   - opaque: NO equations — an error branch is not provably equal to any
     value (strictly stronger claim hygiene than a `:= default` body);
   - axiom-free: the `:= default` initializer only witnesses
     inhabitation; opaque does not expose it definitionally;
   - computable at runtime via @[implemented_by]: panics with the
     message. -/
/- `never_extract` on the IMPLEMENTATION too: the compiler substitutes the
   `implemented_by` target before closed-term extraction, so an attribute
   on the opaque alone does not protect `failwithIImpl "msg"` at a closed
   type from being lifted to module initialisation (measured: `import
   LemLib` alone aborted under LEAN_ABORT_ON_PANIC=1 until this). -/
@[never_extract] private unsafe def failwithIImpl {α : Type} [Inhabited α] (msg : String) : α :=
  panic! msg
/- `never_extract`: a closed application `failwithI "msg"` at a closed
   type is otherwise lifted by the compiler's closed-term extraction into
   a module-initialisation constant, so the panic fired at INIT of every
   importing binary under LEAN_ABORT_ON_PANIC=1 instead of at the failing
   program point — which is where the OCaml reference raises. -/
@[implemented_by failwithIImpl, never_extract]
opaque failwithI {α : Type} [Inhabited α] (msg : String) : α := default

/- Fail-stop for executables ([USER 2026-09-30] agreed D1). A reached
   `failwithI` is a Lean `panic!`:
   unless the runtime aborts, it prints the message and CONTINUES with the
   `Inhabited` default ("library-call semantics"), so a program whose model
   fails could exit 0 with plausible-looking output where the OCaml target
   raises and stops. An executable over generated code calls
   `lemRequireAbortOnPanic` first thing in `main`: it REFUSES to run (an
   attributed message on stderr, exit 2) unless `LEAN_ABORT_ON_PANIC` is
   exactly `1`, so every reached failure is a fail-stop. No extern and no
   unsafe code (an extern that set the runtime's exit-on-panic flag was
   removed by that ruling). The pattern is Cerberus's driver refusal
   (lean_frontend/Main.lean), which measured that the runtime aborts when
   the variable is merely PRESENT ("1", "0" and "" all abort); this check is
   stricter (the value must be `1`). -/
def lemRequireAbortOnPanic : IO Unit := do
  match ← IO.getEnv "LEAN_ABORT_ON_PANIC" with
  | some "1" => pure ()
  | none =>
    IO.eprintln "LemLib lemRequireAbortOnPanic: refused — LEAN_ABORT_ON_PANIC is not set: a reached failure (a Lean panic!) would print and then CONTINUE with a default value where the OCaml target stops; run with LEAN_ABORT_ON_PANIC=1"
    IO.Process.exit 2
  | some x =>
    IO.eprintln ("LemLib lemRequireAbortOnPanic: refused — LEAN_ABORT_ON_PANIC is \"" ++ x ++
      "\", not 1: the Lean runtime aborts on a panic whenever the variable is set, but this check requires exactly 1 so the fail-stop contract has one spelling; run with LEAN_ABORT_ON_PANIC=1")
    IO.Process.exit 2

/- Sequencing: Lem's `let _ = e1 in e2` evaluates e1 for its
   effect (a diagnostic, or a failure that must stop the program, as the
   OCaml exception does). Lean's compiler drops unused pure values and treats
   every Unit value as `()`, so the backend emits
   `lemSeq (fun _ => e1) (fun _ => e2)`. Logically `e2`; the runtime
   implementation forces `e1` first by storing its value in a fresh IO
   reference: a `BaseIO` effect the compiler must keep. (A pure "use" is not
   enough: an `if ptrAddrUnsafe x == 1 then b () else b ()` was simplified
   away, and arity reduction then dropped `a` altogether.)
   BOUNDARY ([USER 2026-09-30] agreed D1): `lemSeqImpl` is on the
   native-seam boundary list as TEMPORARY. Kernel-vs-runtime gap: `lemSeq`
   is a transparent def, logically `b ()`; at run time it also forces `a`.
   It is an exception, by that ruling, to the no-unsafe-effect-projection
   note at the top of this file. Named mover: the failure-monad
   translation (doc/lean-backend/TODO.md item 24), which makes strictness
   part of the semantics and deletes this seam. -/
@[never_extract, noinline] private unsafe def lemSeqImpl {α β : Type} (a : Unit → α) (b : Unit → β) : β :=
  match unsafeBaseIO (do
      let r ← IO.mkRef (none : Option α)
      r.set (some (a ()))
      pure (b ())) with
  | v => v
@[implemented_by lemSeqImpl] def lemSeq {α β : Type} (_ : Unit → α) (b : Unit → β) : β := b ()

/- Comparing function values. OCaml's polymorphic compare
   and structural equality raise `Invalid_argument "compare: functional
   value"` when they REACH a closure, and only then (`GOT [] = GOT []`
   is fine). Backend-derived structural comparisons of types with
   function-typed fields call these at the function-typed positions, so a
   comparison fails whenever it reaches a closure: exactly OCaml's `=`, but
   NOT OCaml's `compare`, which returns 0 for the same closure object
   (physical equality). That is an open discrepancy awaiting a ruling
   (TODO item 32; parity probe p_fn_compare_same_closure). -/
@[never_extract] def lemFunctionalCompare {α β : Type} (_ _ : α → β) : Ordering :=
  failwithI "compare: functional value"
@[never_extract] def lemFunctionalBeq {α β : Type} (_ _ : α → β) : Bool :=
  failwithI "compare: functional value"

/- fuelExhaustedWith: out-of-fuel sentinel for fuel'd defs whose return
   type is pure (no error channel) and possibly polymorphic.
   The witness — any in-scope value of the return type, typically one of
   the worker's own arguments — discharges inhabitation LOCALLY: no
   [Inhabited] constraint propagates into generated signatures, and no
   generated-instance fallback enters the cone. Same load-bearing properties as failwithI: opaque (no
   equations — the fuel-exhausted branch is not provably equal to
   anything, in particular NOT to the witness), axiom-free, and loud at
   runtime via @[implemented_by] panic. -/
@[never_extract] private unsafe def fuelExhaustedWithImpl {α : Type} (msg : String) (witness : α) : α :=
  @panic α ⟨witness⟩ msg
@[implemented_by fuelExhaustedWithImpl, never_extract]
opaque fuelExhaustedWith {α : Type} (msg : String) (witness : α) : α := witness

/- Vector slice — lem `vector` slicing:
   * WIDTH-FROM-RETURN-TYPE: the result length is the implicit `m`
     inferred from the USE SITE's expected type — the same convention as
     mwordExtract/mwordConcat below ("hi is redundant", Isabelle
     Word.slice); the `_stop` argument is therefore IGNORED by design
     (redundant with `m`), and is named `_stop` to say so.
   * OUT-OF-RANGE FAILS LOUDLY:
     the OCaml rep `vector_slice n1 n2 (Vector a) = Vector (Array.sub a n1 n2)`
     (ocaml-lib/vector.ml:33) raises Invalid_argument when the slice is
     not within the array; the previous pad-with-default arm SUCCEEDED
     there. lem's typechecker relates m/start/stop, so the arm is
     unreachable from type-correct generated code on both targets.
   * Injected into the core `Vector` namespace so generated projections
     `v.slice` resolve (a LemLib-local name would need backend
     qualification). -/
namespace Vector
def slice [Inhabited α] {n m : Nat} (v : Vector α n) (start _stop : Nat) : Vector α m :=
  if start + m > n then failwithI "Invalid_argument \"Array.sub\""
  else Vector.ofFn fun i => (v.toArray.extract start (start + m)).getD i.val default
end Vector

/- Message-less variant for 'declare {lean} fuel val' sentinels: the lem
   backtick lexer excludes double quotes, so declares cannot carry a
   message string. Unfolds to the opaque core.
   `never_extract`: without it the
   compiler lifts a CLOSED application `fuelExhausted w` to a module-init
   constant and evaluates the sentinel eagerly (silently, panic messages
   are suppressed during initialisation), so a sufficient-fuel run could
   abort on the sentinel it never reached. Regression: the strict native
   parity probe `tests/comprehensive/parity` `p_lem_size` under
   LEAN_ABORT_ON_PANIC=1. -/
@[never_extract] def fuelExhausted {α : Type} (witness : α) : α :=
  fuelExhaustedWith "lem: fuel exhausted" witness

/- fromJustI: ground-site head for msg-carrying fromJust helpers
   (declare {lean} ground_rep, e.g. cerberus Utils.fromJust). A REAL def:
   the success equation `fromJustI msg (some x) = x` holds by rfl
   (theorems over lookups keep proving); only the failure leaf is opaque
   (failwithI), keeping the cone axiom-free.
   fromJustI1: the msg-less variant (Maybe_extra.fromJust). -/
def fromJustI {α : Type} [Inhabited α] (msg : String) : Option α → α

   Sets and finite maps: Lean translations of Lem's OCaml runtime
   (ocaml-lib/pset.ml, modified by Scott Owens 2010-10-28;
   ocaml-lib/pmap.ml, modified by Susmit Sarkar 2010-11-30).
   Source notices are at the top of this file.
   ============================================================================

   [USER 2026-09-03] ruling: the OCaml target is the reference semantics
   of a lem program and there are to be ZERO behavioural discrepancies.
   An earlier Lean representation (a comparator-keyed insertion-order
   list for sets; a `Std.TreeMap`-indexed, insertion-sequenced `Fmap`)
   did not reproduce the OCaml observables: iteration/fold/toList order
   (OCaml: ascending by comparator), Pmap.add replacing the key AND value
   of a comparator-equal binding, Pmap.equal comparing keys with the
   map's comparator, Set.choose_and_split / set_case / union
   representatives, and every
   panic-order nuance of for_all/exists. Rather than approximate them
   one by one, the two AVL modules follow the source algorithms. Tree
   shape affects observables: which representative of comparator-equal
   but distinguishable elements a `union` keeps depends on subtree
   HEIGHTS in pset.ml. Each function cites its OCaml source line. This
   translation and the finite parity probes are evidence, not a theorem
   about every operation sequence. Comparators are lem's `LemOrdering`; `c = 0`,
   `c < 0`, `c > 0` in the OCaml read `.EQ`, `.LT`, `.GT`.

   Failure parity: where the OCaml raises (Not_found on choose/min_elt of
   the empty set, Invalid_argument in bal/remove_min_elt on ill-formed
   input) the port uses failwithI (exception class (a)). Native execution
   must set LEAN_ABORT_ON_PANIC=1 to abort on a reached panic. Lean may
   erase unused pure failures; general strict-failure parity is not proved.

   Termination: structural where the OCaml is structural on one tree.
   The functions whose OCaml recursion is not structural on one argument
   (`join`; union/inter/diff/subset on two trees via `split`; merge on
   two maps; compare/equal on two enumerations; the closure loop of `tc`)
   are STRUCTURAL RECURSIONS ON A DATA MEASURE — an index computed from
   the arguments that bounds the recursion exactly: the stored AVL
   heights (`height s1 + height s2 + 1`: each level strictly decreases
   the sum; split never increases a height), the element counts, the
   finite square of a relation's endpoints. This is the admissible third
   form of the no-magic-values rule ([USER 2026-09-03]: the rule's aim is to

   rep byte-for-byte, including FAILURE: OCaml raises Division_by_zero
   (native `/`, `mod`, Int32/Int64.div/rem, zarith), so the Lean side
   fails loudly (failwithI — panic, then the Inhabited default; a

   library/num.lem one by one:
   * Int32.of_int / Int64.of_int (int32FromInt, int32FromNat, ...): the

   * Nat_big_num.to_int32 / to_int64 (…FromInteger, …FromNatural,
     …FromNumeral): on the OCaml target zarith raises Overflow outside
     the range; lem's OWN semantics of these conversions is MODULAR —

     OCaml-execution artifact, not mirrored ([USER 2026-09-04];

     (int64FromInt32): sign extension — Int32.toInt64;
   * Nat_big_num.of_int32/of_int64 (integerFromInt32/64): exact — .toInt.
